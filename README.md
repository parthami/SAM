# SAM (Selective Adpative MFA)

Code base for my Final Year Project, "Adaptive selection strategies for mobile multi-factor authentication"

## Abstract

Single factor authentication is the de facto standard for authentication in every
aspect of current digital practises. Two-factor authentication adoption has been
shown in surveys to have increased in the workplace and at home (SafeNet 2014).
The objective of this project is to build on current authentication practises with a
multi-factor authentication application. The solution that was developed is a mobile
application that uses multiple factors to conduct authentication on the device in
addition to a decision process that considers the surrounding environment and past
usage of said factors. This report details the processes, methods and evaluation of
a successful implementation of the application.
